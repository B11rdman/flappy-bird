# Flappy Bird

Couple of things I would like to say.

Unfortunately I had some health problems, that's why I'm a little late from the deadline.

I never used Phaser 3 with TypeScript and I had some difficulties setting up my own boilerplate for that. That's why I decided to use a ready one. But the one I found had older versions of some packages.

I'll work on creating an awesome boilerplate, with latest versions of packages.

And one more thing. The build script is not working properly.

Thank you very much.
Stay healthy!

Sincerely
Arsen
